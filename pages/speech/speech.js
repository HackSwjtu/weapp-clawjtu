            content: "The microgrid represents a unique generation and distribution paradigm that can enable the vision of sustainable and resilient future power systems. The present talk covers several aspects of the operation of microgrids and introduces relevant control problems in such networks. In particular, main operation modes of inverter-interfaced generation units are reviewed and a mathematical model of a microgrid is presented. Furthermore, three important performance criteria in such networks are introduced, namely frequency stability, voltage stability and power sharing. Control schemes to address these problems are discussed. The analysis is illustrated via experimental data and simulation examples of a microgrid based on the CIGRE benchmark medium voltage distribution network."

            content: "Johannes Schiffer received his Diploma degree in Engineering Cybernetics from the University of Stuttgart, Germany, in 2009 and a Ph.D. degree (Dr.-Ing.) in Electrical Engineering from TU Berlin, Germany, in 2015. Currently, he is a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at the School of Electronic & Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, UK. Prior to that, he has held appointments as research associate in the Control Systems Group (2011 - 2015) and at the Chair of Sustainable Electric Networks and Sources of Energy (2009 - 2011) both at TU Berlin. His current research interests include distributed control and analysis of complex networks with application to microgrids and power systems."
